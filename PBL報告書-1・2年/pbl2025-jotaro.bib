Today software technologies are the predominant means of music production, with a vibrant ecosystem for commercial and open-source products. In this work we target VST plugins, the de-facto standard for developing and prototyping music production software. We analyze 15,847 data points over 299 GitHub repositories containing VST plugins. Our results include a systematic quantification of the (i) characteristics of open-source VST projects in terms of, e.g., duration, size, contributors, stars/watchers, licensing, (ii) most used technologies for developing VST plugins, and (iii) code quality and testing practices in VST projects. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the practice in VST plugins development, highlighting successful projects, opportunities for improvement, and future research directions for software engineering researchers.},

  abstract = {Neural audio processing has unlocked novel methods of sound transformation and synthesis, yet integrating deep learning models into digital audio workstations (DAWs) remains challenging due to real-time / neural network inference constraints and the complexities of plugin development. In this paper, we introduce the Neutone SDK: an open source framework that streamlines the deployment of PyTorch-based neural audio models for both real-time and offline applications. By encapsulating common challenges such as variable buffer sizes, sample rate conversion, delay compensation, and control parameter handling within a unified, model-agnostic interface, our framework enables seamless interoperability between neural models and host plugins while allowing users to work entirely in Python. We provide a technical overview of the interfaces needed to accomplish this, as well as the corresponding SDK implementations. We also demonstrate the SDK's versatility across applications such as audio effect emulation, timbre transfer, and sample generation, as well as its adoption by researchers, educators, companies, and artists alike.

  abstract = {Existing designs for collaborative online audio mixing and production, within a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) context, require a balance between synchronous collaboration, scalability, and audio resolution. Synchronous multiparty collaboration models typically utilize compressed audio streams. Alternatively those that stream high-resolution audio do not scale to multiple collaborators or experience issues owing to network limitations. Asynchronous platforms allow collaboration using copies of DAW projects and high-resolution audio files. However they require participants to contribute in isolation and have their work auditioned using asynchronous communication, which is not ideal for collaboration. This paper presents an innovative online DAW collaboration framework for audio mixing that addresses these limitations. The framework allows collaborators to synchronously communicate while contributing to the control of a shared DAW project. Collaborators perform remote audio mixing with access to high-resolution audio and receive real-time updates of remote collaborators' actions. Participants share project and audio files before a collaboration session; however the framework transmits control data of remote mixing actions during the session. Implementation and evaluation have demonstrated the scalability of up to 30 collaborators on residential Internet bandwidth. The framework delivers an authentic studio mixing experience where high-resolution audio projects are democratically auditioned and synchronously mixed by remotely located collaborators.}

  abstract = {Collaborative music production in online environments has seen a renewed focus as developers of Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software include features that cater to limited synchronous participation and multiparty asynchronous collaboration. A significant restriction of these collaboration platforms is the inability for multiple collaborators to effectively communicate and seamlessly work on a high-fidelity audio project in real-time. This paper outlines the design of a browser-based application that enables real-time collaboration between multiple remote instantiations of an established, mainstream and fully-featured DAW platform over the Internet. The proposed application provides access to, and modification and creation of, high-fidelity audio assets, real-time videoconferencing and control data streaming for communication and synchronised DAW operations through Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) and Web MIDI Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The paper reports on a proof-of-concept implementation and results, including several areas for further research and development.}

Existing online music and audio production collaboration platforms and cloud storage cannot replicate intrinsic in-studio interactions between an audio engineer and clients in a professional post-production audio mixing environment. We developed the DAW Collaboration Framework that transitions audio practitioners to a real-time, internet-linked mixing environment. This paper documents our evaluation of the framework's performance through real-world practitioners' perspectives, having participated in professional audio mixing scenarios. Our evaluation attests to the facilitation of a new audio mixing paradigm, where remote participants work synchronously in a collaborative, professional, DAW-based mixing environment, similar to traditional in-studio settings. Every participant monitors high-resolution audio files while accessing complete synchronised mixing control of the shared DAW project. Identified benefits include time savings, increased productivity, and engaging, collaborative audio mixing. This paradigm empowers remote participants to contribute to audio mixing projects, promoting new global reach and business opportunities for audio engineers. We identify impediments to widespread adoption of this new paradigm, thereby posing future research directions. Ultimately, in a pandemic-impacted era of disruptions and travel restrictions, our framework presents a viable alternative to in-person, studio-based mixing.},

  abstract = {Digital audio workstations (DAWs) play a critical role in audio mixing and post-production activities, facilitating audio engineers and clients to work collaboratively in a studio environment. The coronavirus pandemic brought into focus the need to carry out these activities in an effective manner with remote participants. This article explores the requirements for an optimal remote collaboration platform to facilitate post-production audio mixing through a qualitative study. We interviewed a group of Australian-based professional music/sound practitioners about their use of DAWs, work-case scenarios, use of remote control and collaboration features, and perspectives for an "ideal" remote collaborative music post-production environment. We derived several insights from the analysis of this data that can inform the design and development of a new collaboration platform. The evidence showed that the most common practice for remote mixing collaboration is an iterative process of sharing audio files/recordings with audio engineers who perform mixing/post-production work, which is shared back with clients for feedback asynchronously. Professional audio mixing practitioners do not typically engage in real-time remote collaboration outside of remote one-to-one sound source recording because synchronous post-production collaboration methods are unavailable. Our analysis derives a vision for such a platform: a "virtual" remote collaboration environment that emulates an in-studio experience.},

While JavaScript and Web standards are becoming increasingly flexible and powerful, C, C++, and domain-specific languages such as FAUST or Csound remain the prevailing languages used by professional developers of native plugins. Fortunately, it is now possible to compile them in WebAssembly, which means they can be integrated with the Web platform. Our work aims to create a continuum between native and browser based audio app development and to appeal to programmers from both worlds.
